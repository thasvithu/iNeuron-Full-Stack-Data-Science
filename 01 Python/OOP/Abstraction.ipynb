    "Great! Letâ€™s move on to **Abstraction**, the final pillar of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features or interfaces. It allows developers to focus on \"what\" an object does rather than \"how\" it does it. This simplifies interactions with objects and promotes modularity and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weâ€™ll cover the following topics step by step:\n",
    "1. **What is Abstraction?**\n",
    "2. **Abstract Classes and Methods**\n",
    "3. **How to Implement Abstraction in Python**\n",
    "4. **Practical Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. What is Abstraction?**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details and showing only the necessary features of an object.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: It simplifies complex systems by focusing on high-level functionality and ignoring unnecessary implementation details.\n",
    "- **Key Idea**: Abstraction provides a clear separation between the interface (what the object does) and the implementation (how the object does it).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Analogy:\n",
    "Think of a car. You donâ€™t need to know how the engine works internally to drive it. You just need to know how to use the steering wheel, pedals, and gear stickâ€”these are the \"interfaces\" exposed to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Abstract Classes and Methods**\n",
    "In Python, abstraction is implemented using **abstract base classes (ABCs)**. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and may contain one or more **abstract methods**. Abstract methods are declared but do not have any implementation in the abstract classâ€”they must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Abstract Class**: A class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes.\n",
    "- **Abstract Method**: A method declared in the abstract class but without implementation. Subclasses must provide their own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. How to Implement Abstraction in Python**\n",
    "Python provides the `abc` module (Abstract Base Classes) to define abstract classes and methods. To create an abstract class:\n",
    "1. Import `ABC` and `abstractmethod` from the `abc` module.\n",
    "2. Inherit from `ABC` to make the class abstract.\n",
    "3. Use the `@abstractmethod` decorator to declare abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal(ABC):  # Abstract class\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Abstract method\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Implementation of the abstract method\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Implementation of the abstract method\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create objects\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog.speak())  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "print(cat.speak())  # Output: Meow!\n",
    "\n",
    "# animal = Animal()  # TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Animal with abstract method speak\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `Animal` class is abstract because it inherits from `ABC` and contains an abstract method (`speak`).\n",
    "- Subclasses (`Dog` and `Cat`) must implement the `speak` method to be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Practical Examples**\n",
    "Letâ€™s build a practical example of abstraction using a payment system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Payment Gateway\n",
    "Imagine a system where different payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal) share a common interface but have different implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class PaymentGateway(ABC):  # Abstract class\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def pay(self, amount):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class CreditCardPayment(PaymentGateway):\n",
    "    def pay(self, amount):  # Implementation of the abstract method\n",
    "        return f\"Paid ${amount} via Credit Card.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class PayPalPayment(PaymentGateway):\n",
    "    def pay(self, amount):  # Implementation of the abstract method\n",
    "        return f\"Paid ${amount} via PayPal.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create objects\n",
    "payments = [CreditCardPayment(), PayPalPayment()]\n",
    "\n",
    "for payment in payments:\n",
    "    print(payment.pay(100))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Paid $100 via Credit Card.\n",
    "# Paid $100 via PayPal.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `PaymentGateway` class defines an abstract method `pay`, which all subclasses must implement.\n",
    "- Subclasses (`CreditCardPayment` and `PayPalPayment`) provide their own implementation of the `pay` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **5. Combining Abstraction with Encapsulation**\n",
    "Abstraction often works hand-in-hand with encapsulation. While abstraction hides implementation details, encapsulation restricts access to internal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):  # Abstract class\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color):\n",
    "        self.__color = color  # Private attribute (encapsulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_color(self):  # Getter for private attribute\n",
    "        return self.__color\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, radius):\n",
    "        super().__init__(color)\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):  # Implementation of the abstract method\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, width, height):\n",
    "        super().__init__(color)\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):  # Implementation of the abstract method\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create objects\n",
    "shapes = [Circle(\"Red\", 5), Rectangle(\"Blue\", 4, 6)]\n",
    "\n",
    "for shape in shapes:\n",
    "    print(f\"{shape.get_color()} shape has an area of {shape.area()}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Red shape has an area of 78.5.\n",
    "# Blue shape has an area of 24.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `Shape` class uses abstraction to define the `area` method and encapsulation to protect the `__color` attribute.\n",
    "- Subclasses (`Circle` and `Rectangle`) implement the `area` method and inherit the encapsulated `__color` attribute.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "1. **Abstraction** hides complex implementation details and exposes only the essential features of an object.\n",
    "2. Abstract classes and methods are used to enforce abstraction in Python.\n",
    "   - Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.\n",
    "   - Abstract methods must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
    "3. Abstraction simplifies interactions with objects and promotes modularity and scalability.\n",
    "4. Abstraction often works together with encapsulation to hide internal data and expose controlled interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "If asked in an interview, you can say:\n",
    "**\"Abstraction in Python is the process of hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It is implemented using abstract base classes (ABCs) and abstract methods, which force subclasses to provide their own implementation.
