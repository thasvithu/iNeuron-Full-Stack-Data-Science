    "Yes, letâ€™s move on to **Encapsulation**, another fundamental pillar of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also involves restricting direct access to some components using **private** or **protected** attributes. This ensures better control over how the data is accessed and modified, promoting code safety and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weâ€™ll cover the following topics step by step:\n",
    "1. **What is Encapsulation?**\n",
    "2. **Access Modifiers in Python**\n",
    "   - Public\n",
    "   - Protected\n",
    "   - Private\n",
    "3. **Getters and Setters**\n",
    "4. **Practical Examples**\n",

    "### **1. What is Encapsulation?**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).\n",
    "- **Purpose**: It restricts direct access to some components of an object, ensuring that the internal state of the object is controlled and modified only through well-defined interfaces (methods).\n",
    "- **Key Idea**: Encapsulation hides the internal details of how an object works and exposes only the necessary features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Access Modifiers in Python**\n",
    "Python does not enforce strict access control like some other languages (e.g., Java), but it provides conventions for defining public, protected, and private attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A. Public Attributes**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Public attributes are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.\n",
    "- **Convention**: No underscores before the attribute name.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Public attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "person = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "print(person.name)  # Output: Alice\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `name` attribute is public and can be accessed directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Protected Attributes**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Protected attributes are intended to be used within the class and its subclasses. They are not enforced by Python but follow a naming convention.\n",
    "- **Convention**: Use a single underscore (`_`) before the attribute name.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self._name = name  # Protected attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_name(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Name: {self._name}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "person = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "print(person._name)  # Output: Alice (accessible, but not recommended)\n",
    "print(person.display_name())  # Output: Name: Alice\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `_name` attribute is protected, but Python does not prevent access to it. Itâ€™s a signal to developers that it should not be accessed directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **C. Private Attributes**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Private attributes are intended to be used only within the class. They cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "- **Convention**: Use double underscores (`__`) before the attribute name.\n",
    "- **Name Mangling**: Python internally changes the name of private attributes to `_ClassName__attribute` to make them harder to access accidentally.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.__name = name  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_name(self):\n",
    "        return self.__name\n",
    "\n",
    "person = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "# print(person.__name)  # AttributeError: 'Person' object has no attribute '__name'\n",
    "print(person.get_name())  # Output: Alice\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `__name` attribute is private and cannot be accessed directly.\n",
    "- You must use a method like `get_name` to retrieve its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Getters and Setters**\n",
    "Getters and setters are methods used to access and modify private or protected attributes. They provide controlled access to encapsulated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):\n",
    "        self.__owner = owner  # Private attribute\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Getter for owner\n",
    "    def get_owner(self):\n",
    "        return self.__owner\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Getter for balance\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Setter for balance\n",
    "    def set_balance(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount >= 0:\n",
    "            self.__balance = amount\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Balance cannot be negative.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an object\n",
    "account = BankAccount(\"Alice\", 1000)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access private attributes using getters\n",
    "print(account.get_owner())    # Output: Alice\n",
    "print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify private attributes using setters\n",
    "account.set_balance(1500)\n",
    "print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500\n",
    "\n",
    "account.set_balance(-500)  # Output: Balance cannot be negative.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `__owner` and `__balance` attributes are private.\n",
    "- Getters and setters provide controlled access to these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Practical Example**\n",
    "Letâ€™s build a practical example of encapsulation using a `Car` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):\n",
    "        self.__brand = brand  # Private attribute\n",
    "        self.__model = model  # Private attribute\n",
    "        self.__year = year    # Private attribute\n",
    "        self.__mileage = 0    # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Getter for brand\n",
    "    def get_brand(self):\n",
    "        return self.__brand\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Getter for mileage\n",
    "    def get_mileage(self):\n",
    "        return self.__mileage\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Setter for mileage\n",
    "    def set_mileage(self, miles):\n",
    "        if miles >= 0:\n",
    "            self.__mileage = miles\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Mileage cannot be negative.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Method to display car details\n",
    "    def display_details(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.__brand} {self.__model} ({self.__year}) with {self.__mileage} miles.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an object\n",
    "car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access private attributes using getters\n",
    "print(car.get_brand())  # Output: Toyota\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify private attributes using setters\n",
    "car.set_mileage(5000)\n",
    "print(car.get_mileage())  # Output: 5000\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display car details\n",
    "print(car.display_details())  # Output: Toyota Corolla (2020) with 5000 miles.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `Car` class encapsulates its attributes (`__brand`, `__model`, `__year`, `__mileage`) and provides controlled access through getters and setters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation** bundles data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricts direct access to some components.\n",
    "2. Python uses naming conventions to define public, protected, and private attributes:\n",
    "   - Public: No underscore (e.g., `name`)\n",
    "   - Protected: Single underscore (e.g., `_name`)\n",
    "   - Private: Double underscore (e.g., `__name`)\n",
    "3. **Getters and setters** provide controlled access to private or protected attributes.\n",
    "4. Encapsulation promotes code safety, maintainability, and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "If asked in an interview, you can say:\n",
    "**\"Encapsulation in Python is the concept of bundling data and methods into a single unit (class) while restricting direct access to some components. Python uses naming conventions like single underscores for protected attributes and double underscores for private attributes.
