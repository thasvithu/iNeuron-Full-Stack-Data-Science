    "### **1. What is Inheritance?**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (child/subclass) derives from an existing class (parent/superclass).\n",
    "- **Purpose**: It allows the child class to reuse the attributes and methods of the parent class while also adding or modifying functionality as needed.\n",
    "- **Key Terms**:\n",
    "  - **Parent Class (Superclass)**: The class being inherited from.\n",
    "  - **Child Class (Subclass)**: The class that inherits from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. How Does Inheritance Work in Python?**\n",
    "In Python, inheritance is implemented by specifying the parent class in parentheses after the child class name during class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ParentClass:\n",
    "    # Attributes and methods of the parent class\n",
    "\n",
    "class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
    "    # Attributes and methods of the child class\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} makes a sound.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):  # Inherits from Animal\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Overrides the speak method\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} says woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create objects\n",
    "animal = Animal(\"Generic Animal\")\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(animal.speak())  # Output: Generic Animal makes a sound.\n",
    "print(dog.speak())     # Output: Buddy says woof!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `Dog` class inherits from the `Animal` class.\n",
    "- The `Dog` class overrides the `speak` method to provide its own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Types of Inheritance**\n",
    "Python supports several types of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A. Single Inheritance**\n",
    "- A child class inherits from a single parent class.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        return \"Hello from Parent!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "child = Child()\n",
    "print(child.greet())  # Output: Hello from Parent!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Multilevel Inheritance**\n",
    "- A child class inherits from a parent class, which in turn inherits from another parent class.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Grandparent:\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        return \"Hello from Grandparent!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent(Grandparent):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "child = Child()\n",
    "print(child.greet())  # Output: Hello from Grandparent!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **C. Multiple Inheritance**\n",
    "- A child class inherits from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent1:\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        return \"Hello from Parent1!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent2:\n",
    "    def farewell(self):\n",
    "        return \"Goodbye from Parent2!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent1, Parent2):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "child = Child()\n",
    "print(child.greet())    # Output: Hello from Parent1!\n",
    "print(child.farewell()) # Output: Goodbye from Parent2!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **D. Hierarchical Inheritance**\n",
    "- Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        return \"Hello from Parent!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child1(Parent):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child2(Parent):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "child1 = Child1()\n",
    "child2 = Child2()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(child1.greet())  # Output: Hello from Parent!\n",
    "print(child2.greet())  # Output: Hello from Parent!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Overriding Methods**\n",
    "A child class can override (redefine) a method from the parent class to provide its own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"This animal makes a sound.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Override the speak method\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Override the speak method\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create objects\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog.speak())  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "print(cat.speak())  # Output: Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Using `super()`**\n",
    "The `super()` function is used to call methods from the parent class within the child class. This is especially useful when you want to extend (rather than completely override) a method from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} makes a sound.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)  # Call the parent class's __init__\n",
    "        self.breed = breed\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} says woof! It's a {self.breed}.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an object\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
    "print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy says woof! It's a Golden Retriever.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `super()` function calls the `__init__` method of the `Animal` class to initialize the `name` attribute.\n",
    "- The `Dog` class adds a new attribute (`breed`) and extends the `speak` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Practical Example**\n",
    "Letâ€™s build a practical example using inheritance to model different types of vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.brand} {self.model} is starting.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def stop(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.brand} {self.model} is stopping.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Driving the {self.brand} {self.model}.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Motorcycle(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def ride(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Riding the {self.brand} {self.model}.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create objects\n",
    "car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
    "motorcycle = Motorcycle(\"Harley-Davidson\", \"Street 750\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(car.start())       # Output: Toyota Corolla is starting.\n",
    "print(car.drive())       # Output: Driving the Toyota Corolla.\n",
    "print(motorcycle.ride()) # Output: Riding the Harley-Davidson Street 750.\n",
    "print(motorcycle.stop()) # Output: Harley-Davidson Street 750 is stopping.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "1. **Inheritance** allows a child class to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class.\n",
    "2. You can override methods in the child class to provide custom behavior.\n",
    "3. Use `super()` to call methods from the parent class within the child class.\n",
    "4. Python supports various types of inheritance: single, multilevel, multiple, and hierarchical.\n",
    "\n",
    "If asked in an interview, you can say:\n",
    "**\"Inheritance in Python allows a child class to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class, promoting code reuse and modularity. The child class can override methods to customize behavior or use `super()` to extend functionality from the parent class. Python supports different types of inheritance, including single, multilevel, multiple, and hierarchical inheritance.\"**"
