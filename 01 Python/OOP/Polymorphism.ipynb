    "### **1. What is Polymorphism?**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" In OOP, it refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
    "- **Key Idea**: A single interface (method name) can behave differently depending on the object that invokes it.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Promotes code flexibility and allows you to write generic, reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Types of Polymorphism**\n",
    "There are two main types of polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Method overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (e.g., different numbers or types of arguments).\n",
    "- **Note**: Python does not support method overloading directly because it allows only one method with a given name in a class. However, you can simulate it using default arguments or variable-length arguments (`*args` or `**kwargs`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Simulated Method Overloading:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MathOperations:\n",
    "    def add(self, a, b=None):\n",
    "        if b is None:\n",
    "            return a\n",
    "        return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "math = MathOperations()\n",
    "print(math.add(5))       # Output: 5\n",
    "print(math.add(5, 3))    # Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `add` method behaves differently based on the number of arguments passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Method overriding occurs when a child class provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.\n",
    "- **Key Idea**: The method in the child class overrides the method in the parent class, allowing different behavior for different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"This animal makes a sound.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Overrides the speak method\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):  # Overrides the speak method\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create objects\n",
    "animal = Animal()\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(animal.speak())  # Output: This animal makes a sound.\n",
    "print(dog.speak())     # Output: Woof!\n",
    "print(cat.speak())     # Output: Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `speak` method behaves differently depending on the type of object (`Animal`, `Dog`, or `Cat`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Polymorphism with Inheritance**\n",
    "Polymorphism is often used with inheritance to allow different subclasses to implement the same method in their own way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Shape:\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return \"Area calculation not implemented.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):  # Overrides the area method\n",
    "        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):  # Overrides the area method\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create objects\n",
    "shapes = [Circle(5), Rectangle(4, 6)]\n",
    "\n",
    "for shape in shapes:\n",
    "    print(shape.area())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# 78.5 (Circle)\n",
    "# 24 (Rectangle)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `area` method behaves differently for `Circle` and `Rectangle` objects, demonstrating polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Polymorphism with Abstract Base Classes**\n",
    "Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) provide a way to enforce polymorphism by defining a common interface that subclasses must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create objects\n",
    "animals = [Dog(), Cat()]\n",
    "\n",
    "for animal in animals:\n",
    "    print(animal.speak())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Woof!\n",
    "# Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `Animal` class defines an abstract method `speak`, which all subclasses must implement.\n",
    "- Polymorphism ensures that each subclass provides its own implementation of `speak`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Practical Example**\n",
    "Letâ€™s build a practical example of polymorphism using a payment system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Payment:\n",
    "    def pay(self, amount):\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError(\"Subclasses must implement this method.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class CreditCardPayment(Payment):\n",
    "    def pay(self, amount):\n",
    "        return f\"Paid ${amount} via Credit Card.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class PayPalPayment(Payment):\n",
    "    def pay(self, amount):\n",
    "        return f\"Paid ${amount} via PayPal.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create objects\n",
    "payments = [CreditCardPayment(), PayPalPayment()]\n",
    "\n",
    "for payment in payments:\n",
    "    print(payment.pay(100))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Paid $100 via Credit Card.\n",
    "# Paid $100 via PayPal.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `Payment` class defines a common interface (`pay`), and each subclass implements it differently.\n",
    "- Polymorphism allows us to iterate over different payment methods and call the `pay` method generically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "1. **Polymorphism** allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
    "2. There are two types of polymorphism:\n",
    "   - **Compile-Time Polymorphism**: Simulated method overloading in Python.\n",
    "   - **Run-Time Polymorphism**: Method overriding in inheritance.\n",
    "3. Polymorphism works seamlessly with inheritance and abstract base classes to enforce a common interface.\n",
    "4. It promotes flexibility, reusability, and scalability in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If asked in an interview, you can say:\n",
    "**\"Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface (method name) to behave differently depending on the object that invokes it. Polymorphism is commonly implemented through method overriding in inheritance or by enforcing interfaces with abstract base classes. It promotes flexibility and code reuse.\"**"
